# ChorePlanner

 ## Introduction

Growing up with undiagnosed ADHD I often got in to trouble for forgetting to do the chores mum and dad asked me to do. They called me lazy and thougt I was inconciderate but it was never out of laziness or anything like that. I simply forgot. 

Seeing my nephews grow up now I think about how much easier my life as a kid would had been if I had a platform where my parents could assign me the chores they wanted me to do! And image being able to see what tasks they set for my sisters? It would have given everything the transperency I needed as a kid. 

All of this gave me the idea of creating a platform for families to plan their lives.
